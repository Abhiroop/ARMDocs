### Papers
- [Using ARM trustzone to build a trusted language runtime for mobile applications](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2541940.2541949) - Trusted Language Runtime for mobile applications - very close to something that we would like to do (but Cortex-A9 processor, different from our use case of TrustZone-M)
- [Demystifying Arm TrustZone: A Comprehensive Survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3291047) - An extensive and very useful survey on TrustZone (must read)
- [Understanding the Prevailing Security Vulnerabilities in TrustZone-assisted TEE Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9152801) - Why/How do security attacks still exist after TEEs? Looked like a good SoK paper addressing this question (maybe answers the "how" more).

### Videos
- [The ARM University Program, ARM Architecture Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqPJGnBPMM) - Very good basic introduction to the ARM architecture, assembly, etc.
- [May the Trust be with You: Empowering TrustZone-M with Multiple Trusted Environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMh1MXqJBw) - Introduces TrustZone-M slightly and describes the [uTango](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03625.pdf) TEE on it.
